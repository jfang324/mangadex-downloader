## About The Project

A CLI tool that makes it easy to search for and download manga from [MangaDex](https://mangadex.org/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this tool, you will need the following:

-   Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11
-   python-dotenv (if you want to use the .env file, optional unless the API changes)
-   aiohttp
-   Pillow
-   windows-curses (if you are using Windows)

To run the tests, you will need the following:

-   Pytest
-   Coverage
-   pytest-asyncio

### Installation

To install the tool, run the following commands in your terminal:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jfang324/mangadex-downloader.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd mangadex-downloader
```

3. If using Windows, install the windows-curses package:

```bash
pip install windows-curses
```

4. Install the project using pip:

```bash
pip install .
```

5. The script will now be installed in your python scripts directory (probably `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python3.X\Scripts` for Windows users). To run the script, navigate to the scripts directory and run the following command:

```bash
mangadex-downloader
```

6. If you want to be able to run the script from anywhere, you can add the scripts directory to your PATH environment variable.

7. To run the tests, install the development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

8. Run the tests:

```bash
coverage run -m pytest -v
```
